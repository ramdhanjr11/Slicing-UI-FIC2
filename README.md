# Slicing-UI-FIC2 Projects

## Introduction
**Hello** **everyone** ðŸ™Œ, I want to share my exercise on slicing some of the UI that my mentor in **Flutter Intensive Class 2** gave. There are many references that i can use to grow my skills to make an ui that is similar. The following are my plan and my goals to be able to clone an ui with flutter, you are able to see my exercise result from branches that **available**.

## Instruction
Before you run the program, you should **`Clone`** this project to your computer directory, then open your favorite text editor in your computer. For the beginning branch `[main]` you will not see any code instead just **`README.md`**, dont worry, change the branch `[main]` which you want that available on table. after you switched the branch, you should type this git command \: **`git clean -fd`** to remove all files from previous branch, repeat that way if you want to switch to another branch again.

Feel free to contact me if you have any problem while running or installing the program. You can find me in \:
